Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\\n\\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\\n\\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\\nDISCUSSION\\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\\n```\\nls -a\\n```\\n\\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command. \\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\", instance_template='We\\'re currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here\\'s the issue text:\\nISSUE:\\n{issue}\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you\\'re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you\\'re in the repository\\'s root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \\nWhen you\\'re satisfied with all of the changes you\\'ve made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \\n\\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\\n1. IMPORTANT: First step without fail must always be to check the files in the main repo. You can do this by running the `ls -a` action. This will show you all the files in the current directory and be useful for making future decisions.\\n2. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\\n   Then start trying to fix it.\\n   When you think you\\'ve fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\\n   \\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \\n\\n3. If you run a command and it doesn\\'t work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n\\n4. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don\\'t just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It\\'s much quicker. \\n   \\n5. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you\\'d like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn\\'t work, use the linux \\'find\\' command. \\n\\n6. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as \\'create\\', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\\n\\n7. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn\\'t, issue another command to fix it.\\n  \\n8. MOST IMPORTANT: You can and should assign / delegate smaller subtasks (e.g. reproducing the issue) other agents using \\'subtask_execute\\' action. This will allow you to spend most of your time on more complex tasks and also be able to plan better.\\n\\n9. We recommend you work in high-level action space, and use subagents for low-entropy subtasks.\\n\\n10. Do not redo the effort of other agents. If you see that another agent has already done something, you should not redo it. You should build on top of it.\\n\\n(Open file: {open_file})\\n(Current directory: {working_dir})\\nbash-$', initial_state_overall='', final_goal_state_overall='', next_step_template='{observation}\\n(Open file: {open_file})\\n(Current directory: {working_dir})\\nbash-$', next_step_no_output_template='Your command ran successfully and did not produce any output.\\n(Open file: {open_file})\\n(Current directory: {working_dir})\\nbash-$', strategy_template=None, demonstration_template='Here are some demonstrations of how to correctly accomplish this task.\\nIt is included to show you how to correctly use the interface.\\nThe demonstration shows how to use subagents for delegating some less complex tasks (e.g. reproducing the issue) to other agents.\\nYou should use a mixture of both low-level (e.g. ls -F) and high-level (subtask_execute) commands to solve the issue. but mainly we recommend you rely on high level thinking and use the subagents for low-entropy subtasks. \\nPLEASE DO USE THE SUBTASK_EXECUTE COMMAND.\\nYou do not need to follow exactly what is done in the demonstration.\\n--- DEMONSTRATION ---\\n{demonstration}\\n--- END OF DEMONSTRATION ---', demonstrations=['demonstrations/hepllm/root-level-marshmallow-code__marshmallow-1867.traj'], put_demos_in_history=False, format_error_template=\"Your output was not formatted correctly.

Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\\n\\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\\n\\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\\nDISCUSSION\\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\\n```\\nls -a\\n```\\n\\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command. \\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\", instance_template='We\\'re currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here\\'s the issue text:\\nISSUE:\\n{issue}\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you\\'re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you\\'re in the repository\\'s root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \\nWhen you\\'re satisfied with all of the changes you\\'ve made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \\n\\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\\n   Then start trying to fix it.\\n   When you think you\\'ve fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\\n   \\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \\n\\n2. If you run a command and it doesn\\'t work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n\\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don\\'t just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It\\'s much quicker. \\n   \\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you\\'d like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn\\'t work, use the linux \\'find\\' command. \\n\\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as \\'create\\', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\\n\\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn\\'t, issue another command to fix it.\\n   \\n\\n(Open file: {open_file})\\n(Current directory: {working_dir})\\nbash-$', initial_state_overall='', final_goal_state_overall='', next_step_template='{observation}\\n(Open file: {open_file})\\n(Current directory: {working_dir})\\nbash-$', next_step_no_output_template='Your command ran successfully and did not produce any output.\\n(Open file: {open_file})\\n(Current directory: {working_dir})\\nbash-$', strategy_template=None, demonstration_template='Here is a demonstration of how to correctly accomplish this task.\\nIt is included to show you how to correctly use the interface.\\nYou do not need to follow exactly what is done in the demonstration.\\n--- DEMONSTRATION ---\\n{demonstration}\\n--- END OF DEMONSTRATION ---\\n', demonstrations=['trajectories/demonstrations/replay__marshmallow-code__marshmallow-1867__default_sys-env_window100__t-0.20__p-0.95__c-2.00__install-1/marshmallow-code__marshmallow-1867.traj'], put_demos_in_history=False, format_error_template=\"Your output was not formatted correctly.

DO NOT try to solve the entire issue on your own.\\nHere are the subtask instructions from the main agent:\\nSUBTASK:\\nCreate and run a script to reproduce the GitHub issue regarding the serialization precision problem of \\'TimeDelta\\' with these instructions:\\n\\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\\nfrom datetime import timedelta\\n\\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\\nobj = dict()\\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\\n\\nReport the output and any issues encountered during the reproduction. Verify if the output is \\'344\\', which indicates the described rounding error.\\n\\n  \\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you\\'re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you\\'re in the repository\\'s root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \\nWhen you\\'re satisfied with all of the changes you\\'ve made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \\n\\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\\n1. When you think you\\'ve fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\\n \\n If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\\n so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \\n\\n2. If you run a command and it doesn\\'t work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n\\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don\\'t just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It\\'s much quicker. \\n \\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you\\'d like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn\\'t work, use the linux \\'find\\' command. \\n\\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as \\'create\\', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\\n\\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn\\'t, issue another command to fix it.\\n\\n7. MOST IMPORTANT: when you have completed the subtask or facing any issues, please inform the main agent by using the `finish_subtask_and_report_to_main_agent` action, along with all necessary details.\\n     \\n\\n(Open file: n/a)\\n(Current directory: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow)\\nbash-$'"

If line_number is provided, the window will be move to include that line\\ngoto <line_number> - moves the window to show <line_number>\\nscroll_down - moves the window down 100 lines\\nscroll_down - moves the window down 100 lines\\nget_symbols [<path>] - gets all of the symbols in the given file (defaults to current open file if no file is provided)\\ncreate <filename> - creates and opens a new file with the given name\\nsubmit - submits your current code and terminates the session\\nsearch_dir <search_term> [<dir>] - searches for search_term in all files in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\\nsearch_file <search_term> [<file>] - searches for search_term in file. If file is not provided, searches in the current open file\\nfind_file <file_name> [<dir>] - finds all files with the given name in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\\nedit <start_line>:<end_line>\\n<replacement_text>\\nend_of_edit - replaces lines <start_line> through <end_line> (inclusive) with the given text in the open file. The replacement text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly. Issuing the same command a second time will just lead to the same error message again.\\nsummarize <path> - gets a summary of the given file\\n\\n\\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. \\nIf you'd like to add the line '        print(x)' you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code! Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\\n\\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\\n\\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\\nDISCUSSION\\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\\n```\\nls -a\\n```\\n\\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command. \\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\",\n",

       "  'content': 'We\\'re currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here\\'s the issue text:\\nISSUE:\\nTimeDelta serialization precision\\nHi there!\\n\\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\\n\\n```python3\\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\\nfrom datetime import timedelta\\n\\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\\n\\nobj = dict()\\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\\n\\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\\n```\\n\\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\\n\\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\\n\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you\\'re going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you\\'re in the repository\\'s root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \\nWhen you\\'re satisfied with all of the changes you\\'ve made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \\n\\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\\n   Then start trying to fix it.\\n   When you think you\\'ve fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\\n   \\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \\n\\n2. If you run a command and it doesn\\'t work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n\\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don\\'t just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It\\'s much quicker. \\n   \\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you\\'d like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn\\'t work, use the linux \\'find\\' command. \\n\\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as \\'create\\', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\\n\\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn\\'t, issue another command to fix it.\\n   \\n\\n(Open file: n/a)\\n(Current directory: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow)\\nbash-$',\n",

      "\n",

      "from marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\n",

      "Looks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "INSTRUCTIONS:\n",
      "Now, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \n",
      "Remember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \n",
      "When you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\n",
      "Note however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n",
      "\n",
      "NOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n",
      "\n",
      "IMPORTANT TIPS:\n",
      "1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n",
      "   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n",
      "   Then start trying to fix it.\n",
      "   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n",
      "   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n",
      "\n",
      "3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n",
      "   \n",
      "4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n",
      "\n",
      "5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n",

       "Note however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n",

       "1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n",
       "   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n",
       "   Then start trying to fix it.\n",
       "   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n",
       "   \n",
       "   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n",
       "   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n",
       "\n",
       "2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n",
       "\n",
       "3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n",
       "   \n",
       "4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n",
       "\n",
       "5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n",

      "  \"problem_statement\": \"Add a file mode parameter to flask.Config.from_file()\\nPython 3.11 introduced native TOML support with the `tomllib` package. This could work nicely with the `flask.Config.from_file()` method as an easy way to load TOML config files:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\napp.config.from_file(\\\"config.toml\\\", tomllib.load)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, `tomllib.load()` takes an object readable in binary mode, while `flask.Config.from_file()` opens a file in text mode, resulting in this error:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nTypeError: File must be opened in binary mode, e.g. use `open('foo.toml', 'rb')`\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can get around this with a more verbose expression, like loading from a file opened with the built-in `open()` function and passing the `dict` to `app.Config.from_mapping()`:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\n# We have to repeat the path joining that from_file() does\\r\\nwith open(os.path.join(app.config.root_path, \\\"config.toml\\\"), \\\"rb\\\") as file:\\r\\n    app.config.from_mapping(tomllib.load(file))\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nBut adding a file mode parameter to `flask.Config.from_file()` would enable the use of a simpler expression. E.g.:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\napp.config.from_file(\\\"config.toml\\\", tomllib.load, mode=\\\"b\\\")\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\n\",\n",
      "  \"hints_text\": \"You can also use:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\napp.config.from_file(\\\"config.toml\\\", lambda f: tomllib.load(f.buffer))\\r\\n```\\nThanks - I was looking for another way to do it. I'm happy with that for now, although it's worth noting this about `io.TextIOBase.buffer` from the docs:\\r\\n\\r\\n> This is not part of the [TextIOBase](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.TextIOBase) API and may not exist in some implementations.\\nOh, didn't mean for you to close this, that was just a shorter workaround. I think a `text=True` parameter would be better, easier to use `True` or `False` rather than mode strings. Some libraries, like `tomllib`, have _Opinions_ about whether text or bytes are correct for parsing files, and we can accommodate that.\\ncan i work on this?\\nNo need to ask to work on an issue. As long as the issue is not assigned to anyone and doesn't have have a linked open PR (both can be seen in the sidebar), anyone is welcome to work on any issue.\",\n",
